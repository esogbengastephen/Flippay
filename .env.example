# Backend API URL – REQUIRED for payment page rate, minimum purchase, and transaction toggles.
# If unset, the buy page uses default rate (50) and shows "default rate – connect to backend".
# Use the full URL with https:// (no trailing slash). After changing this, redeploy the frontend.
#
# Local (backend on port 3001):
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
#
# Production (Vercel – set in frontend project sendappseven.vercel.app, then redeploy):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://flippayback.vercel.app
